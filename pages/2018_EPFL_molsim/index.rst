The following tutorial is part of the course `Understanding advanced molecular
simulation <http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/understanding-advanced-molecular-simulation-CH-420>`__
held at EPF Lausanne during the spring semester 2018.


Understanding advanced molecular simulation
===========================================

This tutorial makes use of the AiiDA plugins for the `zeo++
<http://www.zeoplusplus.org/>`__ and `RASPA2
<https://github.com/numat/RASPA2>`__ codes.
It is meant to be run inside the `Quantum
Mobile <https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile>`__ virtual
machine.

Screening nanoporous materials
------------------------------

**Task:** Screen a set of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for their
performance in storing methane at room temperature by computing their
*deliverable capacities*, i.e. the difference between the amount of
methane stored in a fully loaded tank (at 65 bar) and an empty tank (at
5.8 bar) per volume.

**Report:** Write a short report (1 page) outlining your approach and
identifying the five MOFs with the highest deliverable capacities.
Include an export of your AiiDA database [1]_.

**Note:** This exercise requires a basic knowledge of python. If you are
not familiar with python, partner with someone who is.
