"You need to choose ``NumberOfInitializationCycles`` and ``NumberOfCycles``. "
"Consider that for every cycle every molecule of your system is selected to "
"perform a MC movement that may be accepted or rejected. If your system is "
"empty or there are a few particles, Raspa tries to perform GCMC insertions "
"(\"swaps\") to fill your system (see UMS, Algorithm 13). The number of "
"particles continues to fluctuate according to the Grand Canonical ensemble, "
"and consider that after ``NumberOfInitializationCycles`` cycles, Raspa start"
" to compute the average number of particles for ``NumberOfCycles`` cycles. "
"Therefore, the number of cycles should be large enough to compute statistics"
" correctly but not too large to waist computational times after your "
"uncertainty is already low. Standard deviation is computed using Block "
"Averages (see UMS pag. 529)."
