"We will launch a Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation and check its "
"results. While for now we will do it ‘manually', workflows (that we will "
"learn later in this tutorial) can automate this procedure considerably."

"calculation, you will need to interact with AiiDA mainly in the ``verdi "
"shell``. We strongly suggest you to first try the commands in the shell, and"
" then copy them in a script “test\\_pw.py” using a text editor. This will be"
