"The average loading of the MOF at a given pressure will be computed using "
"grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with the RASPA code."

"The RASPA code needs several input parameters, some of which you will need "
"to figure out"

msgid ""
"Our simulations are performed under periodic boundary conditions. This "
"means, we need to make our simulation cell large enough that a molecule will"
" never interact with a two periodic copies of any of its neighbors. Given "
"the cutoff radius of $12$ Angstroms, how often do you need to replicate the "
"unit cell of the material?"

"To make things more interesting, we are going to use different force fields."
" Ask your instructor to give you a force field identifier."

"You already performed a small GCMC calculation at 10 bar during the "
"tutorial. Adapt the input file to your needs and run the calculation.Hint: "
"Once running, the calculation should finish within 5 minutes."
