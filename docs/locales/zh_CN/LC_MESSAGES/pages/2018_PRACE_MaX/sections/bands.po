"As a final demonstration of the power of WorkChains in AiiDA, we want to "
"give a demonstration of a WorkChain that we have written that will take a "
"structure as its only input and will compute its band structure. All of the "
"steps that would normally have to be done manually by the researcher, "
"choosing appropriate pseudopotentials, energy cutoffs, k-points meshes, "
"high-symmetry k-point paths and performing the various calculation steps, "
"are performed automatically by the WorkChain."

"The demonstration of the workchain will be performed in a Jupyter notebook. "
"To run it, follow the instructions that were given for the querybuilder "
"notebook in section [sec:querybuilder]. The only difference is that instead "
"of selecting the notebook in the ``querybuilder`` directory, go to "
"``pw/bandstructure`` instead and choose the ``bandstructure.ipynb`` "
"notebook. There you will find some example structures that are loaded from "
"COD, through the importer integrated within AiiDA. Note that the required "
"time to calculate the bandstructure for these example structures ranges from"
" 3 minutes to almost half an hour, given that the virtual machine is running"
" on a single core with minimal computational power. It is not necessary to "
"run these examples as it may take too long to complete. For reference, the "
"expected output band structures are plotted in "
"Fig.[fig:workchainbandstructures]."
