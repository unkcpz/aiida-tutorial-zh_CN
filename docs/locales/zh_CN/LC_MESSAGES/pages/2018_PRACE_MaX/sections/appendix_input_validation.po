"This appendix shows additional ways to debug possible errors with QE, how to"
" use a useful tool that we included in AiiDA to validate the input to "
"Quantum ESPRESSO (and possibly suggest the correct name to mispelled "
"keywords)"

"There are various reasons why you might end up providing a wrong input to a "
"Quantum ESPRESSO calculation. Let’s check for example this input dictionary,"
" where we inserted two mistakes:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/pages/2018_PRACE_MaX/sections/appendix_input_validation.md:25
msgid ""
"The two mistakes in the dictionary are the following. First, we wrote a "
"wrong namelist name (’CTRL’ instead of ’CONTROL’). Second, we inserted the "
"number of atoms explicitly: while that is how the number of atoms is "
"specified in Quantum ESPRESSO, in AiiDA this key is reserved by the system: "
"in fact this information is already contained in the StructureData. Modify "
"the script with this ParameterData. In this case, we use a tool (the input "
"validator that we provide in AiiDA) to check the input file before "
"submitting. Therefore, the behavior will be slightly different from the "
"previous example: the plugin will check for some keys and will refuse to "
"submit the calculation. This kind of mistakes is revealed by either"

"Submitting a calculation. You will see the calculation ending up in the "

"Over the time this kind of trivial mistakes can be annoying, but they can be"
" avoided with a utility function that checks the “grammar” of the input "
"parameters. In your script, after you defined the parameters_dict, you can "
"validate it with the command (note that you need to pass also the input "
"crystal structure, s, to allow the validator to perform all needed checks):"

"The input_helper method will check for the correctness of the input "
"parameters. If misspelling or incorrect keys are detected, the method raises"
" an exception, which stops the script before submitting the calculation and "
"thus allows for a more effective debugging."

"With this utility, you can also provide a list of keys, without providing "
"the namelists (useful if you don’t remember where to put some variables in "
"the input file). Hence, you can provide to input_helper() a dictionary like "
"this one:"
