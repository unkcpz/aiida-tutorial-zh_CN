"At this point you should be able to do queries with projections, joins and "
"filters. Moreover, you saw how to apply filters and projections even on "
"attributes and extras. Let’s discover the full power of the QueryBuilder "
"with a complex graph query that allows you to project various properties "
"from different nodes and apply different filters and joins."

"Imagine that you would like to get the smearing energy for all the "

"the units of this energy and the formula of the structure that was given to "
