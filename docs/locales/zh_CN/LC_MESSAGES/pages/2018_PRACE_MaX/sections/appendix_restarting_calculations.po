"Up to now, we have only presented cases in which we were passing wrong input"
" parameters to the calculations, which required us to modify the input "
"scripts and relaunch calculations from scratch. There are several other "
"scenarios in which, more generally, we need to restart calculations from the"
" last step that they have executed. For example when we run molecular "
"dynamics, we might want to add more time steps than we initially thought, or"
" as another example you might want to refine the relaxation of a structure "
"with tighter parameters."

"and submit the calculation with this input. In this case, we set a very low "
"number of self consistent iterations (3), too small to be able to reach the "
"desired accuracy of 10(^{-14}): therefore the calculation will not reach a "
"complete end and will be flagged in a FAILED state. However, there is no "
"mistake in the parameter dictionary."
