"As a final demonstration of the power of ``WorkChain``\\ s in AiiDA, we want"
" to give a demonstration of a ``WorkChain``, which will take a structure as "
"its only input and compute its band structure. All of the steps that would "
"normally have to be done manually by the researcher -- choosing appropriate "
"pseudopotentials, energy cutoffs, k-point meshes, high-symmetry k-point "
"paths, and performing the various calculation steps -- are performed "
"automatically by the ``WorkChain``."

"The demonstration of the WorkChain will be performed in a Jupyter notebook, "
"that you can :download:`download from here "
"<../notebooks/bandstructure.ipynb>`. There you will find some example "
"structures that are loaded from the Crystallography Open Database (COD), "
"using the COD-importer integrated in AiiDA."

"Note that the required time to calculate the bandstructure for the given "
"structures ranges from ~5 minutes to more than an hour, given that the "
"virtual machine is running on two cores with CPU throttling. It is not "
"necessary to run all these examples as they may take too long to complete. "
"For reference, the expected output band structures are plotted in "
":numref:`fig_calc_bands_1` to :numref:`fig_calc_bands_4`."
