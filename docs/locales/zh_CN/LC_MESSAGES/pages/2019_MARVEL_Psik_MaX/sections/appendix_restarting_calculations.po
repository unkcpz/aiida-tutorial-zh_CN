"Up till now, we have presented several cases where, for example, the wrong "
"input parameters were passed to a calculation, causing it to fail. Often we "
"had to retype a lot of code, to setup a new calculation with the correct "
"inputs. In addition, there are many real-life scenarios where one would need"
" to restart calculations from completed calculations with largely the same "
"inputs. For example when we run molecular dynamics, we might want to add "
"more time steps than we initially thought, or as another example you might "
"want to refine the relaxation of a structure with tighter parameters."

"In this section, you will learn how to relaunch a calculation from one that "
"has already completed, while having the chance to add or change inputs "
"before launching it. As an example, let us first submit a total energy "
"calculation using a parameters dictionary of the form:"

"In this case, we set a very low number of self consistent iterations (3), "
"which is too small to be able to reach the desired accuracy of 10\\ "
":sup:`-14`. This means the calculation will not converge and will not be "
"successful, despite there not being any actual mistake in the parameters "
"dictionary."

"To easily restart from the previous calculation, instead of retyping all the"
" inputs, you can simply use the ``get_builder_restart`` method of the "
"``CalcJobNode``. Just like the ``get_builder`` method of the ``Process`` "
"class, this will create an instance of the ``ProcessBuilder``, except this "
"one will have all the inputs pre-populated based on the node. To do so, "
"simply load the node of a terminated calculation job in a ``verdi shell``, "
"that you want to restart from, e.g.:"

"If you simply type ``restart_builder``, you can see that all the inputs have"
" already been set to those that were used for the original calculation. The "
"only thing that now remains to be done, is to replace those inputs that "
"caused the failure in the first place."

"However, in this Quantum ESPRESSO example even more can be done, by using "
"the results of the previous calculation to speed up the restart. To do so, "
"we simply have to set the input ``parent_folder`` to the remote working "
"directory of the old calculation, i.e.:"

"Note that this particular step is specific to a ``PwCalculation``, but the "
"restart builder concept works for any calculation class. Any of the inputs "
"can be changed or set. For example, you may also want to record that this "
"calculation is a restart, in addition to the provenance graph, by setting "
"the label or description:"

"Ultimately whatever needs to be changed for the restart is up to you, but "
"the restart builder makes it a lot easier. Finally, to submit the restart, "
"since it is a process builder, it works exactly as any other builder:"

"You can now inspect the restarted calculation to verify that this time it "
"actually completed successfully. Using the restart builder, the required "
"code to setup a calculation is much shorter than the one needed to launch a "
"new one from scratch. There is no need to load or create many of the inputs "
"such as the pseudopotentials, structures and k-points, because they were "
"reused from the first calculation."
