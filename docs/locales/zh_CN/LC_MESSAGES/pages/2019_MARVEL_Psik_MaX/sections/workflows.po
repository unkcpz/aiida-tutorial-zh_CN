"The ultimate aim of this section is to create a workflow to calculate the "
"equation of state of silicon. This is a very common task for an *ab initio* "
"researcher. An equation of state consists in calculating the total energy "
"(E) as a function of the unit cell volume (V). The minimal energy is reached"
" at the equilibrium volume. Equivalently, the equilibrium is defined by a "
"vanishing pressure (p=-dE/dV). In the vicinity of the minimum, the "
"functional form of the equation of state can be approximated by a parabola. "
"Such an approximation greatly simplifies the calculation of the bulk "
"modulus, that is proportional to the second derivative of the energy (a more"
" advanced treatment requires fitting the curve with, e.g., the "
"Birch–Murnaghan expression)."

"The process of calculating an equation of state puts together several "
"operations. First, we need to define and store in the AiiDA database the "
"basic structure of, e.g., bulk Si. Next, one has to define several "
"structures with different lattice parameters. Those structures must be "
"connected between them in the database, in order to ensure that their "
"provenance is recorded. In other words, we want to be sure that in the "
"future we will know that if we find a bunch of rescaled structures in the "
"database, they all descend from the same one. How to link two nodes in the "
"database in an easy way is the subject of :ref:`provenancewf`."

"In the following sections, the newly created structures will then serve as "

"Quantum ESPRESSO. This task is very similar to what you have done in the "
"previous part of the tutorial. Finally, you will fit the resulting energies "
"as a function of volume to get the bulk modulus. As the EOS task is very "
"common, we will show how to automate its computation with workflows, and how"
" to deal with both serial and parallel (i.e., independent) execution of "
"multiple tasks. Finally, we will show how to introduce more complex logic in"

"In work chains, instead, to preserve variables between different steps, you "
"need to store them in a special dictionary called *context*. As explained "
"above, the context variable ``ctx`` is inherited from the base class "
"``WorkChain``, and at each step method you just need to update its content. "
"AiiDA will take care of saving the context somewhere between workflow steps "
"(on disk, in the database, depending on how AiiDA was configured). For your "
"convenience, you can also access the value of a context variable as "
"``self.ctx.varname`` instead of ``self.ctx['varname']``."

"The submission in ``run_eos`` returns a future and not the actual "
"calculation, because at that point in time we have only just launched the "
"calculation to the daemon and it is not yet completed. Therefore it "
"literally is a 'future' result. Yet we still need to add these futures to "
"the context, so that in the next step of the workchain, when the "
"calculations are in fact completed, we can access them and continue the "
"work. To do this, we can use the ``ToContext`` class. This class takes a "
"dictionary, where the values are the futures and the keys will be the names "
"under which the corresponding calculations will be made available in the "
"context when they are done. See how the ``ToContext`` object is created and "
"returned in ``run_eos``. By doing this, the workchain will implicitly wait "
"for the results of all the futures you have specified, and then call the "
"next step *only when all futures have completed*."

"very end as it happens for normal functions (*return* is always the last "
"instruction executed in a function or method). Also, note that once you have"
" called ``self.out(link_name, node)`` on a given ``link_name``, you can no "
"longer call ``self.out()`` on the same ``link_name``: this will raise an "
