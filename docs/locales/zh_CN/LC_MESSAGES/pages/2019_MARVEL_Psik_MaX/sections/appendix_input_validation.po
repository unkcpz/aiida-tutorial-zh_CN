"This appendix shows additional ways to debug errors with Quantum ESPRESSO, "
"namely how to take advantage of a powerful tool to validate the input to "
"Quantum ESPRESSO and possibly suggest the correct name to misspelled "
"keywords."

"There are various reasons why you might end up providing a wrong input to a "
"Quantum ESPRESSO calculation. Let's check for example this input dictionary,"
" where we inserted two mistakes:"

"We inserted the number of atoms explicitly: while that is indeed how the "
"number of atoms is specified in Quantum ESPRESSO, in AiiDA this key is "
"reserved by the system, since this information is already contained within "
"the StructureData."

"After we correct the dictionary ``parameters_dict``, we could run the "
"calculation directly. Alternatively, we can use a tool of the the `aiida-"
"quantumespresso` plugin, the 'input helper', which checks the inputs before "
"submitting the calculation."

"In your script, after you define ``parameters_dict``, you can validate it "

"The ``input_helper``  method will check for the correctness of the input "
"parameters. If misspelling or incorrect keys are detected, the method raises"
" an exception, which stops the script before submitting the calculation and "
"thus allows for a more effective debugging."

"With this utility, you can also provide a list of keys, without providing "
"the namelists (useful if you don't remember where to put some variables in "
"the input file). Hence, you can provide to ``input_helper`` a dictionary "
